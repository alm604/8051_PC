# 8051_PC
I want to build an x51-based microcomputer. I see it something like HP LX95 or similar. The project was started from simply x51 system with PAULMON2.1 monitor. Many thanks to Paul Stoffregen for his code. Without this, I would not be able to start work in a new family for me - 8051.
I understand that the core of the 8051 is very slow, but its assembler is quite simple. In addition, new technologies offer us 1-cycle kernels per command, double DPTR, USB, and rich peripherals. In addition, I just have a large amount of P80C552EBA (by NXP) that have more ports, ADC, 2 PWM and a watchdog timer.
For Z80 there are many projects, and 8051 was bypassed. I decided to fix it.
